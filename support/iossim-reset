	#cyan[iOS Simulator reset needed.]

	Sorry, but we could not start the AppGyver Scanner in your iOS Simulator.

	We have launched iOS Simulator without an application.  Now switch to your
	application, select #bold[iOS Simulator] from the menu top menu bar and then
	select #bold[Reset Contents and Settings...]. If you are unable to see the
  simulator, please run the command again.  After this it should be started
  for the reset.

	After you have done this, please start the steroids simulator again.

	Sorry about the trouble, we're trying to find a better way to do this.
