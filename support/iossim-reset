	#cyan[iOS Simulator reset needed.]

	Sorry, but we could not start the AppGyver Scanner in your iOS Simulator.

	We have launched iOS Simulator without an application.  Now switch to your
	application, select #bold[iOS Simulator] from the menu top menu bar and then
	select #bold[Reset Contents and Settings...]

	After you have done this, please start the steroids simulator again.

	Sorry about the trouble, we're trying to find a better way to do this.
