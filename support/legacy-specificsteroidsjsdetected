  Sorry to bother you, but this project's config/bower.json is wrong (and that's our fault)

  There's either a line that says

    "steroids-js": "git://github.com/steroidsjs/steroids-js.git#0.3.5"

  or

    "steroids-js": "git://github.com/steroidsjs/steroids-js.git#0.3.6",

  change this line so that the version tag is not specific past the second digit, but instead, "x"

    "steroids-js": "git://github.com/steroidsjs/steroids-js.git#0.3.x",

  now you can get bugfix updates for steroids.js library with

    steroids update


  Thanks,
