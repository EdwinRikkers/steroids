  Sorry, but in this projects config/application.coffee

  There seems to be a line that says

    Steroids = require "steroids"

  remove this line, and the last line

    module.exports = Steroids.config

  This is due our recent changes that made "Steroids" to be global in node environment.

  Thanks,
