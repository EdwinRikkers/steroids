Sorry, but in this projects config/application.coffee

There seems to be lines that include:

  Steroids.config

All occurrences of variable Steroids must be changed to steroids, f.e.:

  steroids.config

This is due to our recent changes that renamed the "Steroids" namespace to "steroids".

Thanks,
