The AppGyver Build Service allows you to define custom Cordova plugins for your app.

First follow the instructions for building your app on iOS or Android (linked in the Related Guides section above). Then, in the plugins field, include an array of GitHub repos for the custom plugins you want to use, e.g.

{% highlight json %}
[
  {"source":"https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation.git"},
  {"source":"https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-vibration.git"},
  {"source":"https://github.com/phoenix-foundation/steroids-plugin-awesome.git"}
]
{% endhighlight %}

Our Build Service uses the [plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman) tool for adding plugins to your custom builds, so your plugin repo must adhere to Cordova's [plugin.xml][plugin-xml-spec] specification, for the platforms you want to target.

On iOS, our plugins currently require [ARC support](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/ObjectiveC/RN-TransitioningToARC/Introduction/Introduction.html), so make sure the code compiles using ARC.

## Known issue

Currently, there's a known issue with private GitHub repos accessed with a Basic Auth token, e.g. `https://richard.anderson:myawesometoken@github.com/phoneix-foundation/steroids-plugin-awesome.git`. If you need to use a private repo for your plugin, please contact us at [support@appgyver.com](mailto:support@appgyver.com).

## Developing locally with custom plugins

The way to use custom plugins in local development is to build a custom Scanner app using the AppGyver Cloud build service. You do need to set up the build config files as indicated in the [Building your app for iOS][ios-build-config]/[Building your app for Android][android-build-config] guides, including the custom plugins you want to use. Then, when you request a Scanner build, you get a Scanner app that includes the custom plugins you need (your actual project files won't be available in the Scanner build - it just functions as a Scanner).

You can then develop locally with the regular Steroids workflow, and you only need to access the build service to build your `.ipa`/`.apk` once you're ready to release your app (or you want to change your plugins).

Please note that you need to manually include your plugin in your Steroids project's `www/config.ios.xml` or `www/config.android.xml` file. This is done by adding the relevant `<plugin>` tag inside the main `<plugins>` tag, e.g.

{% highlight xml %}
<plugins>
  <plugin name="AwesomePlugin" value="org.phoneixfoundation.plugins.AwesomePlugin" />
</plugins>
{% endhighlight %}

Currently, you need to also include the relevant `.js` and other asset files for the plugin manually in your project â€“ the `<asset>` tag in `plugin.xml` is not supported.
