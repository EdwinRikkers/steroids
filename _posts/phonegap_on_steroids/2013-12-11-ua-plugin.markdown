**This guide has been deprecated.**

The Steroids-supported way to use the Urban Airship plugin is to use [Steroids Add-ons](http://www.appgyver.com/steroids/addons). You can view our fork of the plugin [on GitHub](https://github.com/AppGyver/phonegap-ua-push), but note that we only offer support for users using the Urban Airship plugin via the Steroids Urban Airship Add-on.
