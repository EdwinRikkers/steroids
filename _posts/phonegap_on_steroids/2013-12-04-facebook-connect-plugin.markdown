**This guide has been deprecated.**

The Steroids-supported way to use the official Facebook plugin is to use [Steroids Add-ons](http://www.appgyver.com/steroids/addons). To use the Facebook plugin without the Facebook Add-on, refer to the documentation on the [plugin's GitHub Page](https://github.com/phonegap-build/FacebookConnect), though note that we only offer support for users using the Facebook plugin via the Steroids Facebook Add-on.
