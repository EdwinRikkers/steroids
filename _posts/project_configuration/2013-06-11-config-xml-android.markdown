* [Cordova preferences in config.xml (iOS)][config-xml-ios-guide]

Like Cordova, Steroids uses a `config.xml` file to set universal preferences for WebViews in your app, manage which Cordova plugins are loaded and set whitelisted domains for your app. The structure of `config.xml` is based on the [W3C Packaged Web Apps (Widgets)][widgets] specification, although only a limited set of the available elements are used.

The Android-specific `config.xml` is located at `www/config.android.xml`.

##Configuring preferences

Currently, Steroids doesn't support the preference elements of Cordova's `config.xml` on Android. For more information on the preferences, see the relevant [Cordova documentation][cordova-android-config-xml].

##Configuring plugins

By removing `<plugin>` elements from the `config.xml` file, you can disable parts of Cordova. Note that you normally shouldn't need to disable individual plugins even for production apps â€“ there's no real memory impact if the plugins aren't invoked via JavaScript.

For more information on the API calls associated with each core plugin, see the [Steroids API docs][steroids-api].

Unlike Cordova, Steroids doesn't support `<feature>` elements in place of `<plugin>` elements.

##Domain whitelisting
The `<access>` element manages whitelisted domains for your app. For most cases, you are safe to allow all domains:

{% highlight html %}
<access origin="*" />
{% endhighlight %}

For more granular control, see the [Cordova Docs][cordova-domain-whitelisting] on the subjcet.

##App start location
The `<content>` tag is not used in Steroids to set the initial location of your app. Instead, the `steroids.config.location` property in `config/application.coffee` is used.
