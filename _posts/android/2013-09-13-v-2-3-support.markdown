[AppGyver Scanner for Android][android-scanner] v2.7.9 adds limited support for Android 2.3 devices. The initial release is meant to give developers the ability to develop a Cordova app with Steroids tooling.

## Known issues
* `steroids.js` features have not been tested and likely work erratically or not at all.
* Tabs or other native UI components do not work.
* Serving app files via `localhost` doesn't work. This means that the correct version of `cordova.js` must be included manually in your project. [Download cordova.js v2.7.0 for Android][android-cordova-js].

The Android v2.3 support is provided as-is, but we are still collecting issues not mentioned above for future versions.
