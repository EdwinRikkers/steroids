  <h1>Hello world!</h1>

  <p>This file is located in <code>www/index.html</code> and it's also missing a proper layout and CSS.</p>

  <strong>Let's fix that</strong>

  <p>Edit <code>config/application.coffee</code> so that you enable tabs by uncommenting few lines (enable tabs and the configure block in there).</p>

  <p>Then, <code>$ steroids push</code> and this will get more interesting.</p>
