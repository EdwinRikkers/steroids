  <h1>Hello world!</h1>

  <p>This file is located in <code>www/index.html</code> and it's also missing a proper layout and CSS. If you have an existing PhoneGap project you can place it in <code>www/</code>.  But wait until you see what it means to put your project <em>on Steroids</em>.</p>

  <strong>Let's do that!</strong>

  <p>Edit <code>config/application.coffee</code> so that you enable tabs by uncommenting few lines (enable tabs and the configure block in there).</p>

  <p>Then, <code>$ steroids push</code> and this will get more interesting.</p>
