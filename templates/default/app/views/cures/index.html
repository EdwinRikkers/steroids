<p>This page is generated from <code>app/views/<em>cures</em>/index.html</code>, this time with a different layout.  The layout is automatically applied based on the <em>resource</em> name.</p>

<p>As you make new folders in app, the built in grunt-task takes care of the layouts.</p>

<p>So, <code>www/</code> and <code>app/</code> folders merge together nicely in a folder named <code>dist/</code>.</p>

<p>Steroids also compiles .coffee files for you. There is so much more to come in near future.</p>

<p>Happy hacking,<br/>
Let's keep in touch!</p>
