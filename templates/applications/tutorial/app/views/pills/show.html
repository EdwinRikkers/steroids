<div class="content content-padded">

<h1>Nice transition, eh?</h1>

<p>That was <em>native</em>, not CSS3.  Also, the application wide layout is applied here: the contents of the <code>&lt;%= yield.view %&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>That previous view is still living under this document: you can go back there by tapping the native back button.</p>

<p>Cordova 2.2 (PhoneGap) is included:</p>

<p>
  <a class="button button-positive" id="confirm">navigator.notification.confirm</a>
</p>

<p>The last stop here is below, tap that button below.</p>

<p>
  <a class="button button-main opensModal" data-location="/views/cures/index.html">Open a modal window</a>
</p>

</div>
