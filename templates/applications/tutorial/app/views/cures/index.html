<p>This page is generated from <code>app/views/<em>cures</em>/index.html</code>, this time with a different layout, <code>app/views/layouts/cures.html</code>. If a layout file with the same name as the current resource exists, it will be used instead of the generic <code>layouts/application.html</code> layout.</p>

<p>Steroids supports automatic compilation of CoffeeScript and SASS files: our controller is at <code>app/controllers/cures.coffee</code> and our resource-specific stylesheet is at <code>www/stylesheets/cures.scss</code>.</p>

<p>Steroids has an internal <code>make</code> command, which creates complete .html documents by merging the layouts and associated views, compiles CoffeeScript and SASS files and copies everything in the <code>www/</code> and <code>app/</code> to the <code>dist/</code> folder. The <code>make</code> command is run when you press enter in the terminal running <code>$ steroids connect</code>. You can see the end result in the <code>dist/</code> folder.</p>

<p>There's much more to come in the near future, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>Happy hacking,<br/>
Let's keep in touch!</p>
