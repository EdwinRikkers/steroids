  <h1>Hello world!</h1>

  <p>This file is located in <code>www/index.html</code>. It loads only a basic CSS file and both the Cordova and Steroids.js libraries. (Note that <code>cordova.js</code> is served from outside the project files to ensure that the version compatible with the current version of Steroids is used.)</p> 
  
  <p>If you have an existing PhoneGap project, you can simply place it in the <code>www/</code> folder and enjoy the Steroids toolset, e.g. <code>$ steroids simulator</code> and <code>$ steroids deploy</code>. (Write <code>$ steroids</code> in your terminal to see the full list of available commands.)</p>
  
  <p>Let's not stop there, though. Let's put your project <strong>on Steroids</strong>.</p>

  <p>Edit the <code>config/application.coffee</code> file to enable tabs by uncommenting few preconfigured lines:
    <code>steroids.config.tabBar.enabled</code>, <code>steroids.config.tabBar.tabs</code> and the array that defines the tabs.</p>

  <p>Then, hit enter in the console where <code>$ steroids connect</code> is running, and this will get more interesting.</p>
